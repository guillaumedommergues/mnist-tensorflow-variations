# mnist-tensorflow-variations
Examples of tensorflow syntax

# goals
Expose step by step the basics of the tensorflow syntax, which can be somewhat unsettling. The models are numbered from the simplest to the most complex. Each iteration introduces a new feature / way to increase accuracy. 

# requirements
```
conda create -n mnist python=3.5
activate mnist
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
conda install -c anaconda numpy
```
